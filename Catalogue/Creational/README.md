# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are fundamental to object creation, offering mechanisms that increase flexibility and reusability of code. This section introduces the following creational design patterns:

- **[Factory Method](./Factory_Method.md)**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Allows for the construction of complex objects step by step. It's particularly useful when an object needs to be initialized with many parameters.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is useful when the creation of an object is more convenient or efficient through copying.
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
